# Horiseon-Marketing-Website

## Description 

This project is a code refactor for the Horiseon marketing website which primarily focuses on improving accessibility/user experience, search engine optimisation, and consolidating code for easier maintenance.

## Project improvements and refactoring

* The code now has semantic HTML elements that improves accessibility and provides better structure to the content.
* Improved content organisation and added alt tags to boost the wesbite's search engine optimisation. 
* Added comments to the code in both HTML and CSS to make it easier to understand and maintain the code.
* CSS was reorganised to follow a more logical structure.
* Fixed broken navigation link.
* A relevant title was added.

## Installation
No installation is required to view the website in a web browser. The website is accessible through a URL link or you can download the project files and open index.html in a web browser of your choice.

## Usage
Horiseon can be viewed in a deskptop web browser, however it is not yet optimised for smaller screens such as mobile devices or tablets. Horiseon is a simple, static webpage, but does allow users to navigate to different parts of the page using the working links in the navigation menu.
